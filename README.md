PMW3360 driver implementation for ZMK with at least Zephyr 3.5

THIS driver is ganked from [inorichi's PMW3610 driver](https://github.com/inorichi/zmk-pmw3610-driver) which is based off of [ufan's implementation](https://github.com/inorichi/zmk/tree/support-trackpad) of the driver.

### Important to note that the PMW3360 is very power hungry compared to the PMW3610.  If going fully wireless, you'll need big batteries and, even then, your battery life won't be great.
## Installation

Only GitHub actions builds are covered here. Local builds are different for each user, therefore it's not possible to cover all cases.

Include this project on your ZMK's west manifest in `config/west.yml`:

```yml
manifest:
  remotes:
    - name: zmkfirmware
      url-base: https://github.com/petejohanson
    - name: bullwinkle3000
      url-base: https://github.com/bullwinkle3000
  projects:
    - name: zmk
      remote: zmkfirmware
      revision: feat/pointers-move-scroll
      import: app/west.yml
    - name: zmk-pmw3360-driver
      remote: bullwinkle3000
      revision: main
  self:
    path: config
```

Then, edit your `build.yml` to look like this:

```yml
on: [workflow_dispatch]

jobs:
  build:
    uses: petejohanson/zmk/.github/workflows/build-user-config.yml@core/zephyr-3.5-update
```

Now, update your `board.overlay` adding the necessary bits (update the pins for your board accordingly):

```dts
&pinctrl {
    spi0_default: spi0_default {
        group1 {
            psels = <NRF_PSEL(SPIM_SCK, 0, 8)>,
                <NRF_PSEL(SPIM_MOSI, 0, 17)>,
                <NRF_PSEL(SPIM_MISO, 0, 17)>;
        };
    };

    spi0_sleep: spi0_sleep {
        group1 {
            psels = <NRF_PSEL(SPIM_SCK, 0, 8)>,
                <NRF_PSEL(SPIM_MOSI, 0, 17)>,
                <NRF_PSEL(SPIM_MISO, 0, 17)>;
            low-power-enable;
        };
    };
};

&spi0 {
    status = "okay";
    compatible = "nordic,nrf-spim";
    pinctrl-0 = <&spi0_default>;
    pinctrl-1 = <&spi0_sleep>;
    pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";
    cs-gpios = <&gpio0 20 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;

    trackball: trackball@0 {
        status = "okay";
        compatible = "src,pmw3360";
        reg = <0>;
        spi-max-frequency = <2000000>;
        irq-gpios = <&gpio0 6 (GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW | GPIO_PULL_UP)>;

        /*   optional features   */
        // snipe-layers = <1>;
        // scroll-layers = <2 3>;
        // automouse-layer = <4>;
    };
};
```

Now enable the driver config in your `board.config` file (read the Kconfig file to find out all possible options):

```conf
CONFIG_SPI=y
CONFIG_INPUT=y
CONFIG_ZMK_MOUSE=y
CONFIG_PMW3360=y
```
